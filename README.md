# Americanisation-within-British-English
**Abstract:**

English is the most spoken language all
over the world. However, English hasn’t
always been the same. The arrival of
American English had been an important
factor on the change of the English lan-
guage. Ever since America became the
central country, a lot of countries have
been Americanised. That’s the reason why
British English might have changed too.
Previous research has primarily focused
on the change on the spoken language. In
this study, we focus on this change in writ-
ten English. There have been some stud-
ies in this topic, however those we’re pri-
marily focused on differences in spelling.
We want to focus differences in complete
words. So, we want to figure out whether
there is a correlation between the growth
of American English and the use of cer-
tain words in British English. The aim
of this thesis is to find out whether there
has been an increase of American sayings
and phrases in written English. We will
compare those sayings and phrases to the
use of their British English counterparts.
The results show that the frequency of
Americanisms in British English increases
around the time where American English
was growing the most. This could be very
valuable to take into consideration of what
English variant we should teach our chil-
dren
