# Americanisation-within-British-English
**Abstract:**

English is the most spoken language all over the world. However, English hasn't always been the same. The arrival of American English has been an important factor on the change of the English language. Ever since America became the central country, a lot of countries have been Americanised. That’s the reason why British English might have changed too. Previous research has primarily focused on the change on the spoken language. In this study, we focus on the change of written British English. There have been some studies about topic, however those were primarily focused on differences in spelling. We want to focus differences in complete words. So, we want to figure out whether there is a correlation between the growth of American English and the use of certain words in British English. The aim of this thesis is to find out whether the growth of American English has an impact on the frequency of Americanisms in British English written text. We will compare American English words to their British English counterparts. The results show that the frequency of Americanisms in British English increases around the time where American English was growing the most. This could be very valuable to take into consideration of what English variant we should teach our children.

**Hypothesis**

The more American English becomes important, the higher the frequency of Americanisms in British English written text.

**Method**

We solve this question using Google N-Grams. we compare American English words with their British English counterparts. This comparison shows is the trends of the use of Americanisms in British English. In other words, it shows us the frequency of American English words in written British English texts.
